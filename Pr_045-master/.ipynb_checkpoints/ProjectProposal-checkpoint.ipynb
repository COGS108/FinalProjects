    "San Diego is a fast expanding city. As more people move into the city, the government must decide whether or not to install more public parks or to allow for more commercial and urban expansion. This project would provide a more accurate gauge of the worth of a public park and help governments make more informed decisions about whether or not to add public parks. It could also provide assessments of the worth of already existing parks, and that value could be used to decide how much funding to budget for the maintenance of the parks. Positive personal experiences with many community parks and spaces growing up has led us to our hypothesis that the true value of public parks greatly exceeds the actual monetary cost of building them. This is important because it will provide a financial incentive for governments to install more parks.\n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "Cleaning: The data we will use in this project comes from a wide range of sources. Some of the sources are curated city datasets, which seem to have fairly clean data. Other sources include web-scraping and web-APIs. We expect to encounter a lot of dirty data from our scraped sources. We will toss out any text based data and stick with strictly defined numeric data like housing costs in dollars and Yelp stars as ints. This will speed up the process and allow us to use more data sources, balancing the effect of ignoring some subjective data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "Analyzing: We will be analyzing where current parks are located in San Diego and derive a formula to determine their value, based on various attributes, such as health benefits, environment benefits, and police dispatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each collected and cleaned dataset, we will need to map the data to a uniform spatial scope (i.e. look at all data aggregated on zip-code vs by longitude and latitude).\n",
    "- Then we need to map each dataset to monetary value (i.e. cost of police dispatches, health care savings of decreased obesity).\n",
    "- Next, we will calculate the correlation between park density in a region and each feature’s money value in that region. We will call the correlation value wx for the correlation between park density and the money value of feature x.\n",
    "- Finally, we can define the regional values of parks as V = Σx wxvx . This will account for negative correlations as well as positive (i.e. parks might be a hotspot for crime, increasing the cost of police dispatches to the area, resulting in a negative correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "When reporting, some key insights to keep in mind are the resulting equations that we used to value parks. We will be using many features that can all contribute positively or negatively to the value of parks. Some may have strong correlations with the presence of parks, and others will not. So, it will be interesting to report the correlations of our different features with park presence, and how much each aspect affects park value.\n",
    "Another main reporting goal is a predictor for new park value based on location. This would allow the county of San Diego to make more informed decisions on where parks would provide the most value, and further justify construction costs. This predictor can be presented in real time, and we would like to generate a heatmap of park value over the map of San Diego to report as a static visualization.\n",

    "   We are focusing our analysis on parks within the San Diego region, and features of surrounding areas in order to accurately quantify the monetary value of establishing new parks. We will be looking at locations, housing costs, and other amenities around existing parks. There currently exists only 285 parks in San Diego county which is a significantly smaller dataset. However, observations from other data sets such as police activity (100,000) and housing prices (10,000) offer many observations that can be used in our analysis. The smaller sample sizes for specific features may slightly skew our overall interpretations of the influence each feature has. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Also, because we are collecting data from a variety of different sources, there may be slight discrepancies and lack of overlap in the time frames that each set of data is collected. For example, the data on housing information may come from just 2015-2017 while the police activity data that we have gathered spans 2007-2013. Datasets from a smaller time frame may be more biased because it would be easily influenced by the specific time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Our plan is to use our analysis of the data collected to accurately add monetary value to the parks in San Diego county. Biased data or smaller sample sizes may lead to incorrect or flawed outcomes. Since we are using multiple different datasets, there is a better chance that one bad dataset won't completely skew the outcome. If our hypothesis is wrong, it is possible that there are other more important features that we did not choose to analyze that may have a greater influence on the value a park can add to a region. "
